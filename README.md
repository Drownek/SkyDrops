</div>


## Installation & Prerequisites

**Prerequisites:**

  * Java 17 or higher
  * **[DecentHolograms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decentholograms-1-8-1-21-8-papi-support-no-dependencies.96927/)** (Required for all hologram functionality)

**Quick Start:**

1.  Download the **SkyDrops JAR** from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skydrops.129111/).
2.  Place the JAR into your server's `plugins/` directory.
3.  Restart the server.
4.  Configure global settings via `/skydrops settings`.
5.  Define airdrop contents via `/skydrops edit-drops`.


## Core Functionality

### In-game Configuration

SkyDrops features a complete **GUI-based settings editor**, eliminating the need for manual file editing. All core parameters, including drop announcement times and scheduled intervals, are configurable in real-time.

### Drop Claim Mechanics

To secure an airdrop's contents, players must interact with the drop chest a pre-configured number of times. This introduces a controlled delay to the claim process.
